# Android Boilerplate CLI 

`Really needs a better name`

An opinionated CLI tool for generating and developing Android Projects using a variety of established architectures and coding patterns.

:construction: `Work in Progress` :construction:
### Kotlin
No, you don't need to use Java.

### Android Jetpack
To different degrees depending on the pattern choice

### Single Activity First
These days there are fewer and fewer reasons to rely primarily on Activities as the container for each view. With the advent of Jetpack, most of the headaches that Android developers have experienced in the past simply no longer need exist. Therefore all of ABP's templates assume a Single Activity Paradigm upon creation. Of course there is no enforcement of this pattern after the project is generated but we encourage some thoughtfullness around why additional activities would be needed.

### Koin
A nicer way to inject dependencies

## Tools for development
Using the ```abp``` command, developers can easily create the boilerplate for chosen patterns. This makes writing new features far quicker, easier and less error-prone.
